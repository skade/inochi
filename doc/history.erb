      This release fixes some show-stopper bugs.

      <% paragraph "Contributor kudos" do %>
        * Florian Gilcher tried the first release of **<%= $project %>** and reported bugs.
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph "Bug fixes" do %>
        * Florian Gilcher reported that the name of the project library was [being determined incorrectly](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771351).

        * Florian Gilcher reported that there was a [circular dependency problem](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/176173#771281) problem when installing the **<%= $project %>** gem.

          The solution is to specify the <tt>--force</tt> option when installing the gem.  <%= xref "Installation" %> has been updated accordingly.

        * Generated project scaffolds now check against the major version of the **<%= $project %>** gem, to avoid runtime version conflicts.
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph "Housekeeping" do %>
        * Only add project libraries to `$LOAD_PATH` if not already there.

      This is the first release of **<%= $project %>**.

      Happy birthday!
